# Malware-Run-at-your-own-risk-
A virus that Makes the computer unopenable.(Run ate your own risk)
This is a virus. Every time the pc is turned on it shuts down.
To use it paste the code to a bat file and run it if you want to estroy your pc(I do not recomend that).
I am not in charge of any of the BUULL**** that you will do with it
